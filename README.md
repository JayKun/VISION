<h1>Project VISION</h1>

<h2>Description </h2>
<p>Using the Intel Edison, a camera, a speaker, Node js and Google's Vision API, IBM Watson Text to Speech, my team and I were able to create a visual aid device for
the visually impaired. The basic idea is to take photos of the surrounding using the camera, pipe the image using a web server hosted on
Intel Edison using Node js. Finally, the image is processed using Google's VISION API to obtain a JSON file containing the description of 
object in the image ;the JSON file is converted into a text file and converted into a .wav file using the IBM Watson Text to Speech API.
